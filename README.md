#This is our repisotory to work on the web application together. Please remember to commit updates after you updated something.
If you ever need any help or have questions about something, please feel free to reach out to me (Derriko Lewis). If you are uncertain about something, ask first before commiting updates to avoid messing up the codes in any way. I also advise saving the files yourself and working on it locally before commiting updates.
